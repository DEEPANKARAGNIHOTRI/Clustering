Cluster Analysis using K-Means Algorithm
A dataset of 3 features having a customer's Salary Score, Credit Score and Bill score.
We intend to cluster them using K-Means Algorithm and also use the elbow curve to determine the efficient K value.
We also use the evaluation scheme using SILHOUETTE value of identifying the optimal neighboring distance with the own distance to check our clusters validity.
