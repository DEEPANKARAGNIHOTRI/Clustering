Cluster Analysis using K-Means Algorithm
A dataset of 3 features having a customer's Salary Score, Credit Score and Bill score.
We intend to cluster them using K-Means Algorithm and also use the elbow curve to determine the efficient K value.
We also use the evaluation scheme using SILHOUETTE value of identifying the optimal neighboring distance with the own distance to check our clusters validity.
Have depicted the K-Means using 2 more datasets, Cereal dataset and Wine Clustering data. Will soon paste the link to the dataset.
A small description of Cereal Dataset, the dataset runs the features about the caorie content, fibre, energy etc imilar feature which identifies a certain similar breakfast cereal basis the nutritional content.
A small description about the WINE Problem, here the dataset is about a Wine seller offering a discount and running a offer based on some features.
Feautures are: Offer feature runs from 1-32 based on Campaign feature which runs for month of a year. Minimum feature is the minimun no of purchase one has to make, Discount is simply a discount, Origin is the country origin of Wine, Varietal is type of Wine, Past Peak is the peak value after which the prize of Wine decreases, i.e. it is the categorical value stating the prizing dependency, and rest all features are customer names, who made the purchases basis the discount and offer.
